  API:
  form_for(record, options, &block)
    create form for creating/updating a model record
    record: string/symbol of object or actual object
      string/sym will look for an @ version of itself and pass that to builder
      sets action, method class and id based record and resource routing
        new object gets action="/object/new" method="post" no class or id
        existing object gets action="/object/id" method="patch" (where patch hack is used*)
          class="edit_object" id="edit_object_id"
    yields a FormBuilder
    options: html: {hash of html opts}, url: {custom url}, namespace: {"id_prefix"}

  FormBuilders help build forms by scoping them to a specific model/name
    form_for gives the builder an object (by name at least) to work with
    all name attrs will go inside a hash of name/model specified and you define keys for it (model[])
    Change value of submit if new or existing
    can call model form helpers on builder to automatically provide object_name and set value

  Model formhelpers
    form helpers that make it easier to work w/ models & can be combined with form builders
    like the *_tag variants but take an object_name and method parameter, nesting method in the object_name hash in params
      text_field(:person, :name) == params[:person][:name] => value (can't handle actual instance. Require name)
